==================================
Somethings to think about : 
==================================

- improve sign in process
- create rating system 
- create hardware verification/validation system 
- google analytics

Business Model
- "CHECK QUALITY OF USED Computer hardware before resale ie. provide consumer confidence" 
1."User provides SKU and photos" do initial QC 
SKU API
2. Item gets posted on Website and user is notified to ship when item is sold
3. "if Performance test fails What happens" 
If fails then seller pays for all shipping costs 
Photos different for products
Shipping (esd) packaging 

User authentication process
- how?? have user risk more than 100$ for first sell 
need original packaging 


-  competitive pricing : api's 
- Quality Check (find someone to make test software)
-
